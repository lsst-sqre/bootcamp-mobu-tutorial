## Rebuilding the presentation

This presentation is written in Emacs org-mode, and uses the org-reveal
package to render the presentation outline to reveal.js for
presentation.

You will need to have installed the `org-reveal` package.  After that,
open the [presentation](./mobu-tutorial.org), load the rendering library
with `M-x load-library ox-reveal`.  After having done that, 
`C-c C-e R R` will generate the presentation, which can then be opened
in any web browser.
